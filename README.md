## Introduction
This GitHub repository aims to provide the details of the methodology used to define the acoustic fingerprint of emotions by generating embeddings from acoustic
events that may cause them, answering to the following question: Is it possible to characterize the acoustic events that induce emotions? 

## Summary
We use YAMNet, an acoustic events classifier trained in Audioset to classify acoustic events in the WEMAC Audiovisual stimuli dataset. Each video in this dataset is labelled with the categorical emotion it induces by crowdsourcing. Thus we determine the relevance of the acoustic events to induce each emotion, creating acoustic fingerprints of such emotions, by means of the information retrieval based
TF-IDF algorithm.
